The Airbnb clone project aims at replicating the popular online marketplace for lodging and travel experiences.
This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

Each task is linked and will help you to:
put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.


A command line interpreter, is a program that facilitates the interaction between the user and the operating system. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can input commands using text, and the interpreter translates and executes these commands.
In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object.

• Once you start your shell and the terminal is open
• you can start entering commands

• Example: Type ls and press Enter to list files in the current directory.
and type dir and press Enter to list files in the current directory.
